# Snake_s_Snack

## Introduction:

In this project we have created a simple Snake game using C++ language and raylib library. raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming and it's especially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

Every game structure consists of 2 parts : DEFINITIONS and GAME LOOP.

DEFINITIONS is the part where we define our variables and game objects such as the snake, the food and the gaming arena. The GAME LOOP is responsible for event handling, updating the positions of game objects and checking for collisions. The updates happen so fast that it appears like a continuous movement. The GAME LOOP is run repeatedly until the game is closed. 

We will make this game by breaking it down into smaller parts.
